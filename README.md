ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cheesecoke </br>
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my knowledge in software development.</br>
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refreshing on the basics from taking a few years off.</br>
ğŸ“« You can reach me on insta @cha_co_32</br>

I pound dirt, throw brush, and put wet stuff on hot stuff in the summer. Aiming to click some keys in the winter.
